- To analyse the number of requests for each ip with a bar graph
- To calculate the URL hits in descending order
- To calculate the URL with max hits
- To extract browser and platform from User Agent
- To calculate hits per platform
- To analyse the hits on different platforms using a line graph
- To calculate hits for each browser
- To count the number of http codes
- To calculate the top 10 URL hits for each hour

2 - Log File Analysis - Automation
This file involves automating the above queries by defining functions which all run on clicking the 'SUBMIT' button on the TKinter Interface to give the output for all the above queries. The 'EXIT' button exits and closes the interface.
